# 8 Puzzle Solver

This project is a simple, interactive 8-Puzzle game that you can play, scramble, or automatically solve using the A* search algorithm, powered by the Manhattan distance heuristic. It was developed as part of my Artificial Intelligence laboratory coursework.
## Features

- Interactive Gameplay: Play the 8-Puzzle yourself, making moves with your keyboard (WASD controls).
- Scramble & Solve: Randomize the puzzle and let the A* algorithm find the optimal solution.
- Efficient Solving: Utilizes the A* algorithm with Manhattan distance, ensuring the puzzle is solved in optimal time.

## Example

The example below demonstrates the puzzle being solved by the A* algorithm, followed by a few manual moves using the keyboard:
